\description{
In a statement to a Senate Public Works Committee, a senior executive of Texaco, Inc., cited a study on the effectiveness of auto filters on reducing noise. Because of concerns about performance, two types of filters were studied, a standard silencer and a new device developed by the Associated Octel Company. Noise is in decibels/10. Type 1 = standard, Type 2 = Octel.
