\description{
The dataset holds facts about candy bars read from their nutrition labels. The data are a good example for multiple regression (e.g. what contributes to the calories of a candy bar?). For such an analysis, the indicator variable for nuts appears to work well. Note that 5 sugar-free candy bars are marked as NA in the sugar variable to remove them from analyses using sugar. The data have been standardized on a per serving basis to equalize for different serving sizes.
