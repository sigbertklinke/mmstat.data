\description{
Advertisements for an instructional video claim that the techniques will improve the ability of Little League pitchers to throw strikes and that, after undergoing the training, players will be able to throw strikes on at least 60% of their pitches. To test this claim, we have 20 Little Leaguers throw 50 pitches each, and we record the number of strikes. After the players participate in the training program, we repeat the test. The table shows the number of strikes each player threw before and after the training.
