\description{
Yvon Hopps ran an experiment to determine optimum power and time settings for microwave popcorn. His goal was to find a combination of power and time that would deliver high-quality popcorn with less than 10% of the kernels left unpopped, on average. After experimenting with several bags, he determined that power 9 at 4 minutes was the best combination. To be sure that the method was successful, he popped 8 more bags of popcorn (selected at random) at this setting. The data report the percentages of uncooked popcorn.
