\description{
A company that traditionally made rulers and yardsticks is setting up a manufacturing process to make metersticks. Obviously, accuracy is important for their new product. The company runs a 24-hour production process. Using a calibration set of data they found: X = 1.000 R = 0.0016 They took a sample of 3 metersticks each hour and recorded the results.
