\description{
A school district superintendent wants to test a new method of teaching arithmetic in the fourth grade at his 15 schools. He plans to select 8 students from each school to take part in the experiment, but to make sure they are roughly of the same ability, he first gives a test to all 120 students. The data hold the scores of the test by school.
