\description{
A pharmaceutical company tested three formulations of a pain relief medicine for migraine headache sufferers. For the experiment, 27 volunteers were selected and 9 were randomly assigned to one of three drug formulations. The subjects were instructed to take the drug during their next migraine headache episode and to report their pain on a scale of 1 = no pain to 10 = extreme pain 30 minutes after taking the drug.
