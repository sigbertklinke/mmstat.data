\description{
Motorcycles designed to run off-road, often known as dirt bikes, are specialized vehicles. The dataset holds data on 114 many attributes of dirt bikes. Some cost as little as $1399, while others are substantially more expensive. One interest is in building a model to predict the price of a dirt bike from attributes of the bikes.
