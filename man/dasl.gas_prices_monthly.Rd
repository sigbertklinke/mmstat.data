\description{
Many drivers of cars that can run on regular gas actually buy premium in the belief that they will get better gas mileage. To test that belief, we use 10 cars from a company fleet in which all the cars run on regular gas. Each car is filled first with either regular or premium gasoline, decided by a coin toss, and the mileage for that tankful is recorded. Then the mileage is recorded again for the same cars for a tankful of the other kind of gaso-line. We don’t let the drivers know about this experiment.
