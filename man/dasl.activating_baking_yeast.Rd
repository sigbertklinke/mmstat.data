\description{
To shorten the time it takes him to make his favorite pizza, a student designed an experiment to test the effect of sugar and milk on the activation times for baking yeast. Specifically, he tested four different recipes and measured how many seconds it took for the same amount of dough to rise to the top of a bowl. He randomized the order of the recipes and replicated each treatment 4 times.
