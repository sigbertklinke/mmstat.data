\description{
WinCo Foods, a large discount grocery retailer in the western United States, promotes itself as the lowest priced grocery retailer. In newspaper ads WinCo Foods published a price comparison for products between WinCo and several competing grocery retailers. One of the retailers compared against WinCo was Walmart, also known as a low price competitor. WinCo selected a variety of products, listed the price of the product charges at each retailer, and showed the sales receipt to prove the prices at WinCo were the lowest in the area. A sample of the products and their price comparison at both WinCo and Walmart are given.
