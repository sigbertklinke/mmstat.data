\description{
Thirteen overweight women volunteered for a study to determine whether eating specially prepared crackers before a meal could help them lose weight. The subjects were randomly assigned to eat crackers with different types of fiber (bran fiber, gum fiber, both, and a control cracker) and cycled through several of the cracker alternatives. Unfortunately, some of the women developed uncomfortable bloating and upset stomachs. Researchers suspected that some of the crackers might be at fault. The study was paid for by the manufacturers of the gum fiber, who hoped this would be a new diet tool. What would you recommend to them about the prospects for marketing their new diet cracker?
