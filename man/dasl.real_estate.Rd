\description{
As a class project, students in a large Statistics class collected publicly available  information on recent home sales in their hometowns. There are 894 properties. These are not a random sample, but they may be representative of home sales during a short period of time, nationwide. Among the variables available is an indication of whether the home was in an urban, suburban, or rural setting.
