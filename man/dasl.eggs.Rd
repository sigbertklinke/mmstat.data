\description{
A student wants to investigate the effects of real vs. substitute eggs on his favorite brownie recipe. He enlists the help of 10 friends and asks them to rank each of 8 batches on a scale from 1 to 10. Four of the batches were made with real eggs, four with substitute eggs. The judges tasted the brownies in random order.
