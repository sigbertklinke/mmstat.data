\description{
Psychology experiments sometimes involve testing the ability of rats to navigate mazes. The mazes are classified according to difficulty, as measured by the mean length of time it takes rats to find the food at the end. One researcher needed a maze that will take rats an average of about one minute to solve. He tested one maze on several rats, collecting the data provided.
