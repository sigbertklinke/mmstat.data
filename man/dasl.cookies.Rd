A student performed an experiment to compare chocolate chip cookie recipes. He baked batches of cookies with different amounts of Sugar: 0.5, 0.375, and 0.25 cups, with three different kinds of oil, and with three different kinds of Chips: milk, semisweet, and dark chocolate. Cookie quality was scored on a 0 to 10 scale by other students in the class, with the mean score being the result for each recipe. The experiment design was a Latin Square.
