#' Ansur 2 data
#' 
#' The Anthropometric Survey of US Army Personnel (ANSUR 2 or ANSUR II) data were published internally in 2012. 
#' They were made available publicly in 2017. They have replaced ANSUR I as the most comprehensive 
#' publicly available data set on body size and shape. They include 93 measures for over 
#' 6,000 adult US military personnel (4,082 men and 1,986 women). In contrast to the ANSUR I data, 
#' the new sample includes reservists. Despite the presence of reservists in the sample, it is still 
#' not an approximation of the US Civilian population. Consequently, while there is useful information here, 
#' designs and standards based on these data will not accommodate most user populations in the intended manner.
