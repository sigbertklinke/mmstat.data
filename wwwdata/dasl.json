MacDonell (Biometrika, Vol. I., p. 219).\u201d His method was to write the 3000 finger length values on cards, shuffle them thoroughly, and the deal out 750 hands of 4 cards. For each hand he then calculated (with a mechanical calculator) the mean and standard deviation. (Note; He divided by n (= 4) and not by n-1 (= 3).) He then found values of ybar &#8211; the population mean (which he knew because he had the population; it is 11.5474) and divided each by the standard deviation.
